constructor:
  args: ["0x2024d5508E889FC952b21dFbC9b54DA3dB8DE62A"]        # The argument(s) to be passed to the contract constructor
  value: 0               # The amount of wei to be sent to the contract upon deployment
  #gas: 1000000          # The gas limit to execute the contract constructor, default is the response value of the eth_estimateGas JSON-RPC
